Autonomous
-Do nothing
-Drive to hopper and shoot
-Drive to lift and load gear

//Vector PID
//Consolidate vector + rotation PIDs
Motion profiling X + Y
Motion profiling vector
PID control Talon using Versa planetary encoder
Finish robot SDF model
Write gyro rotation PID for practice chassis
Use gyro instead of encoders for drive modes?

Version control working across multiple computers
Thoughtful source code layout
-clean up main code to mirror simulator code
-consolidate simulator and real source code into one Git tree?

Drive rotation modes
-Robot-oriented
-Field-oriented
-Perp. intake
-Snap to gear lift
-Snap to boiler

Driving notes
-get and place gears quickly with and without defense
-fill up with balls when defended, then shoot when not defended
-know defense rules
-preferred shot: hide behind airship?
